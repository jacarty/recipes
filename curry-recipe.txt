For the curry
    4 boned, skinned chicken breasts (weighing approximately 560g/1 lb 4oz in total)
    salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    4 tbsp vegetable oil
    5cm/2in piece cinnamon stick
    6 cardamom pods, cracked open
    6 cloves
    140g/5oz onions, cut into fine half-rings

    1-3 hot green chillies, cut at a diagonal into fine strips
    ½ tsp black or yellow mustard seeds
    1 clove garlic, finely chopped
    cooked basmati rice, to serve

Method
    -Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
    -Put the tomato purée in a bowl and mix with one tablespoon of water.
    -Add all the remaining sauce ingredients, in the listed order, mixing as you go.
    -Spread out the chicken breasts and season them generously on both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
    -Put three tablespoons of the oil in a non-stick frying pan and place over a high heat.
    -When hot, add the cinnamon, cracked cardamom pods and cloves.
    -After ten seconds, add the chicken breasts in a single layer and brown them lightly on both sides.
    -Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a single layer in an ovenproof dish.
    -Add the onions, ginger, and green chillies to the same frying pan and fry them in the residual oil until they are golden-brown in colour.
    -Remove with a slotted spoon and spread evenly over the chicken breasts.
    -Add the remaining one tablespoon of oil to the frying pan. When hot, add the mustard seeds. As soon as they pop - this will be just a few seconds - add the garlic and stir.
    -As soon as the garlic starts to brown, pour in the sauce.
    -As soon as the sauce heats up and starts bubbling, pour it over and around the chicken without displacing the onion mixture.
    -Place the ovenproof dish, uncovered, in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.
    -Serve immediately with basmati rice.
